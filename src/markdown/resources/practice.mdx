I believe that alternating between short periods of learning and practice is the best way to learn programming.
Here is a list of practice projects, tools, and opportunities to apply the theoretical knowledge you have learned.

ðŸ’¡ A simple approach is to look at a piece of software you like and develop a small component or [MVP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) of it.
