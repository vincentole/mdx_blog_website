There are many libraries and frameworks that make web development a breeze. Here are some of my
favorites that I use regularly.

## TypeScript

[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) is a programming language that builds on JavaScript
and optionally adds static typing. Type safety reduces the potential for errors because it indicates
errors at compile time rather than at runtime. Static typing your code also causes you to think
about your data structures before you start writing into the blue. Finally, one of my favorite side
effects of static typing is that it allows you to use auto-completion where it wasn't possible
before. Of course, there are other benefits that you can find out if you try it for yourself.

## TailwindCSS

[TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) is a utility-first framework that comes with predefined CSS
classes. The big advantage of this is the easy maintainability and a very small CSS code base. With
easy-to-remember predefined classes, you can quickly create a website without having to switch
between CSS and HTML files. Finally, you don't have to worry about naming conventions as often, and
the predefined style system allows you to be creative within reason. Believe me, once you try it,
you won't want to go back.

## React.js

[React.js](https://reactjs.org/) is a JavaScript library that lets you create user interfaces in a
declarative way. You write JSX (which is like HTML with JavaScript functionality) and React figures
out how to render it. This way, you don't have to deal with the verbose DOM API yourself. Two key
features of React are its component-based approach and the ability to declare application state.
This makes it easy to write single-responsibility components that rely on state and props (function
arguments), in addition to JSX, to determine when and what to render.

## Next.js

[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) is a React.js framework that provides many features needed for
production. It has built-in routing, api routes, hybrid static site and server rendering, TypeScript
support, and much more. The great thing is that minimal configuration is required to get started,
and Next.js integrates nicely with Vercel, the cloud hosting company that develops Next.js. If you
want to get try it out, you can build great things and host them for free thanks to the free tier
plans that many companies offer today.

## Headless UI

## Meraki UI

[Meraki UI](https://merakiui.com/) is a library of Tailwind CSS components that support RTL
languages and are fully responsive, based on Flexbox and CSS Grid with elegant dark mode. It is easy
to integrate them into React components and customize them according to your needs.
