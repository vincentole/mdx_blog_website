# The story begins

Hello everyone, I am happy to share with you that I have started my journey to becoming a software
engineer. In this blog series, I'll document my progress along the way, the challenges I've faced
and how I've overcome them, as well as information I wish someone had told me about beforehand.

First, let me introduce myself. I'm in my late 20s and have a pretty diverse background that helps
me a lot when dealing with different topics. After earning my two bachelor's degrees in _Media
Production_ and _Economics and Business Economics_, I worked for [PwC] (https://www.pwc.com/) in the
finance sector for some time.

## A little prequel

When I was younger, I built my first computer completely by myself and I was very passionate about
games (mainly CS 1.6, CS GO, WoW and LoL). However, I never dove deeper into programming than
modifying a few WordPress templates for our gaming website at the time. During my studies I learned
the basics of JavaScript and while working at a local advertising agency I learned more about HTML,
CSS and Content Management Systems (CMS). During my time at PwC, I became very interested in the IT
industry in general and wished I could put my own ideas for software products into action. I
searched online for a structured program that I could complete alongside my full-time job and
decided to pursue the [CompTIA A+](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/a) and
[CompTIA Network+](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/network) certifications.

I loved the security sections of the CompTIA courses and started hacking some boxes on
[HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.com/) and [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/), which is super
fun and I can only recommend it. I also wanted to get some more profound knowledge and started the
[eLearnSecurity PTPv5 program](https://legacy.elearnsecurity.com/course/penetration_testing/).

During this time, I decided to pursue a master's degree in _Quantitative Economics_ because I liked
the idea of combining academic and quantitative work with programming. During the first semester, I
successfully completed _Machine Learning_, _Statistical Computing_, and _Agent Based Modeling_
courses, among others. I also took the Coursera course
[Machine Learning by Stanford University and Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning),
which is fenomenal. However, in data science, I always felt that something was missing because I did
not have a product at the end. Most of the time, the end result was a report or a notebook that
needed to be built into a product.

## Let there be code

While exploring other training opportunities, I came across a 6-month bootcamp/program for front-end
developers that was supported by the government. Since I had no other programming courses, I was
missing that experience. On the front-end side, I really liked that I could see the results of my
work directly.. So I applied for the program and started right away to brush up on my HTML5 and CSS3
skills. I mainly used the [MDN Learning Path](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn) and
some YouTube tutorials like [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/c/TraversyMedia),
[Academind](https://www.youtube.com/c/Academind) or
[Freecodecamp](https://www.youtube.com/c/Freecodecamp).

Of course, I also watched some _roadmap_ videos to get a feel for what technologies are being used
today and in what order I should learn them. The best resources I found were two videos from
[whatsdev](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtsvokdIqwY) and
[Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqzUcMzfV1w&t=2253s), and two articles/websites
from [kamranahmedse](https://roadmap.sh/frontend) and
[Thu Nghiem](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-learn-web-dev-in-2021-roadmap/).

While getting a general feel for the current technology stack and learning the newest HTML5 and CSS3
features, I was getting super excited about front-end development and when I got accepted to the
bootcamp/program I decided to fully commit to this path.
